- location: Format as follows:
    * If full details known: "City, State/Province, Country"
    * If only city and country known: "City, Country"
    * If only country known: "Country"
    * Always capitalize proper nouns

- salary_range: Standardized format like "$100K-$150K" or empty string if not provided
- company_name: Clean company name (capitalize words)
- description: Cleaned job description

Important rules for standardization:
1. For any missing, undefined, or unclear values, always use an empty string ('') instead of 'N/A', 'None', 'NULL', or similar text
2. Be consistent with capitalization:
   * Use proper capitalization for job titles, company names, and locations
   * Keep "Yes"/"No" responses capitalized
   * Keep status values ("Remote", "Hybrid", "On-site") capitalized
3. Remove any special characters or unnecessary whitespace
4. Ensure values match the expected formats described above
5. If information is ambiguous, prefer empty string over guessing
