A job posting MUST include:
    - Specific job title(s)
    - At least TWO of the following:

Indicators of multiple job postings:
    - Multiple distinct job titles
    - Different sets of requirements

    - Lists of different roles
    - Separate sections for different positions

Respond only with "True" for single job posts or "False" for multiple job posts."""

CV_MATCHING_PROMPT = """You are a technical recruiter evaluating candidate CVs against job requirements.

Analyze the match between the CV and job post using these three key areas:

1. Experience Match (40% of final score):
   - Years of Experience Match (50%): Compare required vs actual years
   - Domain Knowledge Match (30%): Evaluate industry and domain expertise
   - Project Scale Experience (20%): Assess complexity and scale of projects

2. Skills Match (45% of final score):
   - Technical Skills Match (40%): Must-have technical requirements
   - Education Requirements Match (25%): Required education level
   - Tools and Technologies (20%): Required tools and frameworks
   - Professional Certifications (15%): Relevant certifications

3. Soft Skills Match (15% of final score):
   - Communication Skills (30%): Written and verbal communication abilities
   - Team Collaboration (30%): Experience in team environments
   - Problem-Solving Approach (20%): Analytical and solution-oriented mindset
   - Cultural Values Alignment (20%): Work style and company culture fit

Scoring Guidelines:
95-100: Exceeds all requirements
85-94: Meets all requirements
75-84: Meets most requirements
65-74: Meets basic requirements
50-64: Meets some requirements
0-49: Missing critical requirements

Step-by-step evaluation process:
1. First, analyze each component within the three key areas:
   - For Experience Match:
     * Assess years of experience: [Your reasoning here]
     * Evaluate domain knowledge: [Your reasoning here]
     * Analyze project scale experience: [Your reasoning here]
     * Calculate Experience Match score: [Your calculation]

   - For Skills Match:
     * Evaluate technical skills: [Your reasoning here]
     * Assess education requirements: [Your reasoning here]
     * Review tools and technologies knowledge: [Your reasoning here]
     * Check professional certifications: [Your reasoning here]
     * Calculate Skills Match score: [Your calculation]

   - For Soft Skills Match:
     * Evaluate communication skills: [Your reasoning here]
     * Assess team collaboration: [Your reasoning here]
     * Review problem-solving approach: [Your reasoning here]
     * Analyze cultural values alignment: [Your reasoning here]
     * Calculate Soft Skills Match score: [Your calculation]

2. Then calculate the final weighted score:
   - Experience Match (40%): [Score] x 0.4 = [Weighted score]
   - Skills Match (45%): [Score] x 0.45 = [Weighted score]
   - Soft Skills Match (15%): [Score] x 0.15 = [Weighted score]
   - Final Score: [Sum of weighted scores]

IMPORTANT: Calculate all numeric values yourself. Do not include any mathematical expressions.
Return only the final calculated score as a single number."""

CLEAN_JOB_POST_PROMPT = """You are an expert at standardizing job posting data.

For each job posting, extract and standardize the following fields:
- job_title: The standardized job title (capitalize words)
- seniority_level: Exactly one of: "Junior", "Mid-Level", "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Executive", or empty string if unclear
- location: Format as follows:
    * Physical location + work type: "City, State/Province, Country (Remote)" or "London, UK (Hybrid)" or "Berlin, Germany (On-site)"
    * Remote only: "Remote" or "Remote, US only" or "Remote, EMEA"
    * Always capitalize proper nouns
    Never return partial/incomplete locations
- salary_range: Standardized format like "£100K-150K" or "€100K-150K" (with appropriate currency sign) or empty string if not provided
- company_name: Clean company name (capitalize words)
- description: Cleaned job description containing only essential information:
    * Key responsibilities and requirements
    * Core job duties
    * Critical qualifications
    * Important company context
    * Remove any fluff, marketing language, or redundant information
- skills: List of all technical and professional skills, comma-separated, ordered by importance (most critical first)

Important rules for standardization:
1. For any missing, undefined, or unclear values, always use an empty string ('') instead of 'N/A', 'None', 'NULL', or similar text
2. Be consistent with capitalization:
   * Use proper capitalization for job titles, company names, and locations
   * Keep work type values ("Remote", "Hybrid", "On-site") capitalized
3. Remove any special characters or unnecessary whitespace
4. Ensure values match the expected formats described above
5. If information is ambiguous, prefer empty string over guessing
6. For skills:
   * Extract only technical and professional skills (not soft skills)
   * Order by importance/priority (most critical first)
   * Use standard terminology (e.g., "Python" not "python programming")
   * Remove duplicates
   * Limit to most relevant 15-20 skills total
