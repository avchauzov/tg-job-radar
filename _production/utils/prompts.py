2. At least TWO of the following:
   - Job responsibilities or requirements
   - Application instructions or process
   - Employment terms (salary, location, work type)
   - Company hiring information
   - Recruiter or hiring manager contacts

Examples of job postings:

‚ùå "Learn Python in 30 days"
